## Why I made the thing:

I needed a new back plate after installing Maple Leaf Makers upper rear bowden inlet. https://github.com/MapleLeafMakers/V0_Upper_Rear_Bowden_Inlet
My old back plate was bought in a kit back in the 0.1 days and I did not want to try and cut it. So, natrualy I fired up the 2.4 and fusion 360 and whipped this up. I put a honeycomb grid in it because it looks cool and to keep the electronics cooler. My pi liked to throttle when the printer was idle.
