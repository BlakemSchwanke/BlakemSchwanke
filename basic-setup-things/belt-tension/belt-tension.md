# How to tune belt tension on your voron

## Equipment needed

1. A phone to run a spectum analyzer app
2. A ruler or some sort of device used to measure distance
3. A voron

## This is how its done

Grab hold of your trusty ruler or other device and measure 150mm of belt as shown in the picture below. I like to measure center to center of two pulleys. On a V0 you simply need to move the gantry to the rear of the printer and measure the inside belts.
